# TaskManagerProject
A project to create a task manager program from a small business.  

## Function
The program allows the registraton of emplyees and stores their details, as well as the creation of tasks which stores information such as their start date,
due date, name, discription, and who they have been assinged to. The Admin user can then generate reports on the tasks, as well as the users. The user reports
give statistics outlining how many tasks have been assinged to the users and if they have completed them in time. The task reports give statistics on the 
general state of the tasks, for example, how many are currently overdue.

## Uses
This program would be useful to any business looking to keep track of projects and the performance of their employees.
